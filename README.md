# Binary-Search
This repository implements and compares Naive Search and Binary Search algorithms in Python. Naive Search checks each list element sequentially ( 𝑂 ( 𝑛 ) O(n)), while Binary Search efficiently halves the search space in sorted lists ( 𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑛 ) O(logn)). A script demonstrates Binary Search's speed advantage on a list of 10,000 integers.
